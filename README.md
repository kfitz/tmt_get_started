# tmt_get_started

This is a set of two tutorials originally developed by [Miriam Posner](https://miriamposner.com), designed to give you your first hands-on experience with topic modeling, using the [Topic Modeling Tool](https://github.com/senderle/topic-modeling-tool), a GUI implementation of [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/). 

Begin by following the instructions to install the [Topic Modeling Tool](https://github.com/senderle/topic-modeling-tool) on your own computer.

Once that's done, click through to begin [Tutorial One: Messing Around with the Topic Modeling Tool](https://github.com/kfitz/tmt_get_started/blob/master/messing-around-with-the-topic-modeling-tool.md).

You're also welcome (but not required) to explore [Tutorial Two: Visualize Your Topic Model](https://github.com/miriamposner/tmt_get_started/blob/master/visualize-your-topic-model.md). This one assumes that you've been introduced to [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/); you can begin by exploring Miriam Posner's [Tableau Public tutorial](https://github.com/miriamposner/get-started-with-tableau/blob/master/getting-started-with-tableau-public.md) if you like.

Have fun!
