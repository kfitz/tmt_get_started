# tmt_get_started

This is a set of two tutorials intended to give college students their first hands-on experience with topic modeling, using the [Topic Modeling Tool](https://github.com/senderle/topic-modeling-tool), a GUI implementation of [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/). These tutorials are meant to be used in class following a lecture that covers the theoretical foundations of LDA. For the second tutorial of this set of two, students should have some experience using Tableau Public. (You can find a Tableau Public tutorial [here](https://github.com/miriamposner/get-started-with-tableau/blob/master/getting-started-with-tableau-public.md).)
